# Random Animals Web Application

A site created in Flutter. To view the source code, check out the lib folder! 

## The breakdown of the site

Uses the API https://zoo-animal-api.herokuapp.com to retrieve facts about various zoo animals. Created my own Animal data class to store this API data and then show it on the site. Used state managment within the home page to allow for the user to retrieve a random animal everytime they click a button. Checkout the site here: https://nicholaswlee.github.io/random_animals/#/
